        SeaTrade beta-test version - instructions
        =========================================


This is a new beta-test version of my latest Amiga game, Sea Trade. The game
takes place on a 1024*1024 square map, with 128 cities divided into 5 different
colour groups. You have to carry cargo and passengers between the cities.

Start the game by typing "SeaTrade" at the CLI prompt. If you have a saved game,
you can give the filename as a command line argument to SeaTrade and it will
load the game.

You will first see a screenmode requester. Select a suitable screenmode and
click OK to start the game. You should have at least half a megabyte of free
Chip memory and at least one megabyte of free other memory (Chip or Fast) to
avoid problems. The game requires a display of at least 320*256, with 8
bitplanes (256 colours). This means the game won't work on a stock OCS/ECS
Amiga - AGA or a graphics card is required!

When the game starts, you find yourself in the possession of a Spider ship (the
cheapest ship in the game), and 100 credits. Search the surrounding sea to find
a city. You can steer the ship by clicking on the directional buttons on the
top right corner, or with the cursor keys or the numeric keypad.

When you are in a city, dock by clicking on the Dock button. Inside a city you
can buy/sell cargo by clicking on the "Buy/Sell Cargo" button. This opens a new
window, where you can choose the cargo type, enter how much you want, and then
click on "Buy" or "Sell". When buying cargo, you pay full price, but when
selling, you only get 90% of the price. Close the window to continue.

You can also sell your ship or buy a new ship in the city. Clicking on "Buy a
new ship" opens a window to view the ships available in the city. Select the
one you want and click on "Buy". The ship will be selected as your current ship
so you can equip it with crew, fuel and food.

Transferring people and cargo between ships can be done by clicking on
"Transfer". If there are more than one ship in the city you will be asked
which ship you want to transfer with. The ship named "«Something»" is not a
real ship - it's the city's storage warehouse, which can't move out of the
city. You can leave the city by clicking on "EXIT".

Note that all cities belonging to the same colour group tend to have the same
imports and the same exports. To make a profit, you should ship between
different colour groups. If you see a city in the game window, clicking on the
city will show a list of the city's imports and exports. You can also press the
M key to show a small map of your surroundings. Close the window or press M
again to resume.

Roughly, the colour groups are something like the following:
Central - Luxury residences, like Earth in Frontier
Northwest - Mining colony
Northeast - Natural woodlands and farms
Southwest - Industrial grounds
Southeast - Urban metropolis
This should give you a general idea of what to trade where. Have fun!
