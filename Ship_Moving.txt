Procedure ShipMove
{
    If (Ship has less than 1 move left)
        return;
    Perform necessary weight alterations;
    Calculate moves still left;
    If (Ship has at least 1 move left)
    {
        Move;
        Decrease moves by 1;
    }
    If (All ships have less than 1 move left)
    {
        Increase time by previously calculated increment;
        Recalculate time increment so that slowest ship gets 4 moves;
        Increase all ships' moves by the amount they got;
